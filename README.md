## About Me

Howdy! My name is Aaron Gotreaux. I am a software engineer based in Texas. The bulk of my experience is within the e-clinical, financial and insurance sectors as a full stack Java developer.

I enjoy wrestling with legacy systems, tinkering with unfamiliar stacks and writing clean solutions to puzzles.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you'd like to chat or discuss your project with me as I am looking to become more active as a contributor to projects that interest me.

## Current Projects

* Backfilling [**my solutions**](https://github.com/atgotreaux/advent-of-code) for [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/), an Advent calendar of programming puzzles.
* Redesigning [**my personal website**](https://github.com/atgotreaux/site) @ [**gotreaux.com**](https://gotreaux.com/).
* Prototyping a webservice in secret that I hope to have launched sometime in 2025.
